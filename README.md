## About Loan Manager

This is basically a Loan Management System built with laravel 7. Clients can be registered, given loans and payments made by clients recorded.
On every transaction, the cliet receives an sms. 
The system also automatically sends sms to clients whose payment dates are due or those who have taken long without paying.

LoanManager is very easy to use with a very nice interface deisgned by [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/sb-admin-2).
